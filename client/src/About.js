### Functionalities

The app consists of a few functionalities and data. We start off with the json file where we seed our database with different hero information and posts that our main character provides whenever he feels like it. We “fetch” our data from our local computer which mimics an api server and converts the response to json to be understandable to React. Essentially our functionalities are the ability to “GET”, “POST” and “DELETE”.
